Brain Tumor Detection using CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)

This project focuses on automated brain tumor detection from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT). The goal is to classify MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories (or tumor types, if extended) with high accuracy.

üîç Project Overview

Brain tumors are life-threatening if not detected early. Manual MRI analysis is time-consuming and prone to errors.
This project leverages deep learning architectures to assist radiologists and healthcare systems by providing fast and reliable predictions.

CNN captures local spatial features such as edges and textures.

ViT (Vision Transformer) captures global dependencies using self-attention, making the model robust to complex patterns.

A comparison is provided between CNN and ViT performance.
